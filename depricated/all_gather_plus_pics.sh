#/bin/bash

#This script has a few for loops that are run multiple times that could probably be made into a function in the future where parameters are passed in a more resonable way. For now, this works... It takes about an hour to run bbecause helm pull is so slow. Google had a distributed pull tool that helped make those much faster, but bitnami charts are still VERY slow... we should explore some sort of distributed curl or wget tool in the future... I think there is a library written in Go we map eventually be able to use?
