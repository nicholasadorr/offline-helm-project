# Offline-Helm-Project
Perfect for pulling together all the Dependencies needed to port to an offline env
This is and always will be a Free and Open Source Project

## Containerized Helm Charts
We currently package the following helm charts into a container for transport to an offline environment
* Helm Charts Stable (to be depreicated)
* Helm Charts Incubator (to be depricated)
* Bitnami Charts
* Rancher Stable Charts
* Rancher Latest Charts
* Vm-Ware Charts
* Rook-Operator Charts

1) Run the container
```
docker run --name helm-packages -it docker.io/slvs/helm-packages sh
```
2) Then from a sperate terminal
```
docker cp helm-package:/helm-charts.tar .
```
3) Clean up
```
docker rm --force helm-package
```

With more to come! As Helm Hub replaces Helm Charts and projects host their own repos we will be replacing the charts found in Helm Stable with those
